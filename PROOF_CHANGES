- Rewrote read_passphrase to use THROW_TYPE(), and also not declare a return
value at the beginning of the function, instead electing to return a compound
literal at the end of the function. The result is clearer AutoCorres output.
- Changed read_passphrase so that nv_auth is initialized when it is declared;
this results in one less conjunct in the output monad
- Simplified read_passphrase so that NULL is passed in as the session when
NV_OWNER_REQUIRED is not defined. This again resulted in cleaner AutoCorres
output
- Changed init_heap() to use an ASSERT rather than a condition to check
whether the heap has already been initialized
- The algorithm used by alloc() to determine the number of blocks to be allocated
was susceptible to unsigned integer overflow. Therefore changed the
(n + k - 1) / k
to
(n / k) + 1
which is safe, but may over-allocate blocks. Should fix this later!
- The size check in alloc() was wrong! it should have been (node->size < blocks),
but it was (node->size < size). This was a serious bug.
- Removed all division operators, replaced them with bit-shifts. This wasn't
essential to the proofs, but it may help with reasoning about alignment
- The size check in alloc() was still wrong! It ACTUALLY should have been
(node->size <= blocks), so that we still have space to allocate a new node
with size 0 at the very end of the heap.
- Reordered node assignment, with the "important" node assignment happening
second. This made it feasible to use the h_val_id rule.
