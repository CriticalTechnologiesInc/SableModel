- Rewrote read_passphrase to use THROW_TYPE(), and also not declare a return
value at the beginning of the function, instead electing to return a compound
literal at the end of the function. The result is clearer AutoCorres output.
- Changed read_passphrase so that nv_auth is initialized when it is declared;
this results in one less conjunct in the output monad
- Simplified read_passphrase so that NULL is passed in as the session when
NV_OWNER_REQUIRED is not defined. This again resulted in cleaner AutoCorres
output
