This repo is meant for SABLE proofs.

DO NOT include *.o files in the repo! This can easily be avoided by running 'make clean' before making edits.
DO NOT make commits which throw warnings or errors.


There are two compiler flags:
DEBUG shows debugging output
SAVE_TPM skips the TPM functions which wear down the TPM over time (ie. NVWriteValue())

Example:
make DEBUG=TRUE SAVE_TPM=TRUE
